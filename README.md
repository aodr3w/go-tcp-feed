Go TCP Feed

A simple TCP-based message feed written in Go. This application allows clients to publish messages to a shared feed in near-real-time, with all messages stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Description

Go TCP Feed is a command-line application that uses two TCP ports:
	‚Ä¢	Port 3000 for reading messages (subscription)
	‚Ä¢	Port 2000 for writing messages (publishing)

Multiple clients can connect to these ports to send and receive messages in real time. The PostgreSQL database ensures persistence and maintains message history.

Features
	- Publish Messages: Any user can send a message by entering a name (minimum 4 characters) and typing out their message.

    - Subscribe to Feed: A ‚Äúfeed‚Äù client displays all new messages in near real time.
    
    - Server Logging: Logs both read and write connections, as well as successful user creations.

Requirements
	-	Go 1.18+.

	-	Docker and Docker daemon running (for the PostgreSQL container) .

	-	tmux installed (on macOS you can install via brew install tmux).


Quick Start

1.	Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/aodr3w/go-tcp-feed.git
cd go-tcp-feed


2.	Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

If you have a .env file, environment variables (e.g., PG_PASS, DB_USER, DB_NAME) will be automatically loaded by the Makefile.

3.	Build and Start the Application

make app
‚Ä¢	Installs missing dependencies on macOS (like tmux).
‚Ä¢	Checks/starts Docker.
‚Ä¢	Launches a PostgreSQL container for storing messages.
‚Ä¢	Spins up server, feed, and publisher in separate tmux sessions.

4.	View Running Sessions
```
tmux ls
```

You should see sessions named server, feed, and publisher.

Usage and Sample Logs

Publisher Session
	‚Ä¢	Publisher allows you to publish messages under a chosen username:

```
2025/01/10 21:43:11 PostgreSQL connected , tables created
name (atleast 4 characters): << john
2025/01/10 21:44:37 userID-john
<< hello world my name is john  üòÑ
<< happy to be here üíØ üî•üòé
<<
```



Feed Session
	‚Ä¢	Feed session displays all messages as they arrive:

```
2025/01/10 21:43:11 PostgreSQL connected , tables created
john >> hello world my name is jon üòÑ [1/10/2025 18:45:01]
john >> happy to be here üíØüî•üòé [1/10/2025 18:45:26]
```



Server Session
	‚Ä¢	Server accepts connections on two ports (3000 for read, 2000 for write):

```
2025/01/10 21:43:09 PostgreSQL connected , tables created
[readMessages] 2025/01/10 21:43:09 server is accepting connections on 3000
[writeMessages]  2025/01/10 21:43:09 server is accepting connections on 2000
[readMessages] 2025/01/10 21:43:11 new connection received
[writeMessages]  2025/01/10 21:44:37 user successfully created: &{1 john}
```

Stopping Everything

When you‚Äôre done, stop the Docker container and tmux sessions with:

make stop

This terminates the PostgreSQL container and kills any related tmux sessions.
